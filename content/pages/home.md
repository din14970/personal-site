My name is Niels.
I'm interested in a lot of things related to science and tech.
Currently, I work as a data engineer at Data Minded, a consultancy based in Leuven, where I build cloud native big-data solutions for startups and enterprise.
Before going into data engineering I was a researcher in materials science and electron microscopy.
I did my Ph.D. in physics at the University of Antwerp and the Belgian Nuclear Research Center, after which I did a post-doc at the Max-Planck-Institute für Eisenforschung in Düsseldorf, Germany.
I researched metals and alloys, radiation effects in nuclear materials, small-scale microstructural characterization, and advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy methods.
I've been a longtime enthusiast of python, data, high performance computing, Linux and open source software.
This website is a little side project where I want to write about things that interest me and share random things I learned.

<h2>How this site was made</h2>
The site started as a small personal project to experiment with static site generators, front-end web design, and self-hosting a website. To create it, I used <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> and employed elements of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. The source code for this site is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/din14970/personal-site">Github</a>.
