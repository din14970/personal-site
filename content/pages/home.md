My name is Niels.
Online I often use the alias din14970.
I like to work at the interface between science, tech, software and data.
</p>

<p>
By training I'm a materials scientist and physicist. 
For my Ph.D. I investigated the effects of high energy radiation on metals at the nanoscale using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT).
As a postdoc researcher I delved deeper into electron imaging physics and developed image processing routines for large multidimensional TEM datasets.
</p>

<p>
I'm also a longtime enthusiast of Python, data, high performance computing (HPC), Linux and open source software.
During my postdoc I contributed extensively to python based open source TEM data analysis packages, using the scientific python stack in addition to libraries like cupy, numba, and dask.
I worked as a data engineering consultant where I implemented data pipelines for enterprise clients with PySpark, python, Docker and Kubernetes on an AWS based data platform.
As a freelancer I built scientific software for a major TEM manufacturer.
Currently I'm working as a data scientist and scientific software developer at VITO, working on computer vision projects with PyTorch and TensorFlow.
I'm also interested and involved in scientific data management efforts.

<h2>How this site was made</h2>
The site started as a small personal project to experiment with static site generators, front-end web design, and self-hosting a website. To create it, I used <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> and employed elements of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. The source code for this site is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/din14970/personal-site">Github</a>.
