Summary: After being active as a researcher in the physical sciences for six years, I will transition into the seemingly disconnected data engineering. To reach closure, this post presents my thoughts, reasons, and doubts, and is both an ode to and lament of the current state of science.

### Why I went into science ... or engineering
Kids career choices are rarely taken seriously by adults.
They have an idealized and simplistic picture of the world and can't comprehend all the nuance involved with choosing a career.
Kids always choose jobs that can be summarized in a simple sentence or explained in a picture, like astronaut, firefighter, teacher, and doctor.
At least, so adults like us smugly tell ourselves, as we simultaneously perform mental gymnastics to rationalize the importance and impact of our gig as business analyst or scrum master.
We tell ourselves that we did, in fact, make all the right decisions to get here.
Something, something, business value and customer satisfaction, am I right?

After very a brief astronaut phase as a very young kid, I turned my full attention to a career as a scientist.
In my family this was a first.
My parents both worked in different departments at the corporate office of a large bank.
In their family they were both the first and only ones to attend university.
Still, there was zero mathematical or scientific aptitude within my family.

As a kid I saw my parents slaving away at "shuffling paper" and discussing incomprehensible nonsense with industry jargon.
Twenty years later I'm thankful for the sacrifices they made to raise my brother and I, but I admit I still don't fully comprehend what they actually do.
Even though I'd never read the book, I very much vibed with the sentiment of ["Bullshit Jobs"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) by David Graeber.
To a large extent I still do.
What do people actually do all day in these glass towers?
What are they achieving and why are they doing this, when most of them would rather do something else?

Young me also didn't understand why almost all people were doing meaningless jobs when there were so many pressing societal problems: climate change, cancer, poverty, pollution and more.
Was no one taking these issues seriously?
Why was everyone so content with mediocrity?
I vowed I would do something with real impact, something world changing, something I could truly be proud of: being a scientist.
At 14 years of age, I wrote a stern letter to myself about how I should apply myself to achieve this goal.
As I wasn't a very good student at the time, I also wanted to be realistic and wrote

> "... but probably this will not happen and you will just work in an office at a boring job."

Still, I had a fighting spirit, and for the rest of my secondary education a core feature of my identity was distinguishing myself academically, especially in maths and the sciences.

My efforts *almost* paid off when I received a conditional offer to read engineering at the university of Cambridge starting in the fall semester of 2010.
With the best of intentions, my parents had steered me from pure sciences towards engineering.
I had an aptitude for math, chemistry and physics and was unsure of which course to pick. 
They suggested engineering combined the best of math, chemistry and physics, so I could continue to do a bit of everything.
Plus, engineers are more employable and have more interesting career prospects, am I right?
Despite hitting the grade requirements for math and sciences, I underperformed in history and English, thereby missing Cambridge's grade total requirement.
In August of 2010 I was ultimately rejected, and so in October I embarked on engineering studies at the KU Leuven in Belgium.

### From engineering to materials science to physics
I'm still not decided whether engineering was a mistake.
I think in retrospect I would have preferred to study Physics.
Engineering certainly destroyed all the interest I previously had in chemistry.
But it did introduce me to materials science.
After a year and a half of common (math) courses I picked a minor in chemical engineering and major in materials engineering.
Aside from the friends I made in lectures (which I rarely attended), I hated every part of chemical engineering.
In high school chemistry involved cool reactions.
Chemical engineering was all about the thermodynamics of hydrocarbon mixtures, efficient distillation towers, and systems of differential equations that described industrial chemical processes.
I understood that this was more significant to the world economy than color changes in a beaker, but I just didn't care. 

By contrast, I really found the good student in myself with materials science/engineering.
Materials science had that feel of an unexplored wild west.
The entire periodic table is fair game and an infinite processing parameter space can be explored to make better materials.
Only a few small corners of this infinite dimensional space have been explored.
That is partly because materials science finds its origins in metallurgy which is a sophisticated art dating back to the bronze age.
Development of new materials used to be a purely empirical endeavor.
Only in the last century, with the development of tools to probe processes at the micro- and nanoscale, did materials science mature into a proper science with explanatory and predictive characteristics.
The ultimate goal of materials engineering is designing compositions and processes that yield materials with the desired properties.
Properties can be interpreted in the broadest sense, and result from a hierarchy of structure in the material, from the distribution of alloying elements, to the way atoms assemble into crystal lattices, to nanoscale inclusions and defects.
At the smallest scale, materials science requires an amalgamation of solid state physics, complicated chemistry and thermodynamics.
To study and probe these phenomena requires a zoo of complex experimental and modeling techniques based on mounds of clever physics.
At the macroscale materials science blends into mechanical engineering with techniques like finite element modeling and mechanical testing.
This broadness of the field really appealed to me, I wanted to understand how these properties (e.g. yield strength or conductivity) *emerged* from the smallest scale.

In the masters I picked the specialization route "Materials for nanotechnology", as I was most interested in the exotic properties resulting directly from quantum phenomena like magnetism or 


### Acknowledgements
We like to think our trajectory in life is fully in our control.
It's easy to look back and identify all the wise decisions we made to end up where we are.
But in key decision making moments we rarely know where the options will lead us, many decisions are a pure toss up with tremendous consequences.
It is the other people in our life who help us find the way through this foggy maze, acting either as a shepherd or a source of light.
Rarely do we give them the credit they deserve.

So here I'd like to thank the great tea
The fact I landed on science and engineering is probably a consequence of an innate ability to grasp the subject matter, and the inability to write well-structured essays (yielding me terrible grades in literature and humanities courses).
However, the tremendous influence of good and bad teachers can not be overstated.
I have to thank L. Yuen, my 8th grade science teacher, for sparking my interest in the subject way back in 2005.
Something about Mr. Yuen's style just made it "click", and since taking his class the sciences (except biology) were my best subjects by far.
In high school, I became especially fond of chemistry thanks to J. Craig.
I was pretty bad and unmotivated math student until the final two years of high school, during which I had the privilege of being in the class of C. Galaty.
Mathematics went from one of my worst grades to one of my best, and I even decided to write my final paper (the infamous "Extended Essay" of the International Baccalaureate program) on a subject in math.
I finally "got" physics, thanks to the titanic efforts of the energetic yet patient K. Brock, combined with my newfound interest in math.
But I must also recognize the computer science course by M. Jaworski, which got me into game making, THE hobby of my teenage years, and which built my foundations for programmatic thinking.

By the end of my secondary education, I was firmly convinced I wanted to continue my education in something S.T.E.M. related.
I was debating between pure math, physics, chemistry and engineering, but my parents swayed the vote towards engineering.
According to them this was because it combined the sciences and math "so I would still be able to do a bit of everything"; more likely is that in their eyes it would give me the best chances on the job market.
In Belgium, engineering has a weird kind of prestige attached to it; people are convinced that everyone who studies it must be a genius and rakes in serious dough.

The first crack in my superiority complex formed after I opened the rejection letter from Cambridge University on August 10th, 2010.
I had achieved the required grades for math, physics and chemistry to begin the studies, but I did not achieve the required point total (I got 39/45, 42/45 was required).
Ultimately, this meant that I was rejected from studying engineering at Cambridge because of worse than expected results in history and English literature.
Plan B was enrolling at the University of Leuven, where I quickly discovered I was not even in the top 10% of students.
Like so many kids before me, I discovered that being the smart kid in your high school doesn't mean shit.

I hated the bachelors in engineering.
I chose a major in materials engineering and a minor in chemical engineering.
Why materials engineering?
The introductory course seemed fun and it seemed like the path less traveled.
The minor in chemical engineering destroyed my love for chemistry with its focus on semi-empirical thermodynamic relations and modeling of industrial equipment like distillation towers.
The program was insufficiently practical, so in the end I couldn't even build anything like the stereotypical engineer should be able to.
The materials science program was hit and miss. 
I enjoyed the subjects that went deep into the theory of how things worked at a fundamental level.
I think part of the reason was because there was always a big element I didn't understand but wanted to.
Later, I realized that these subjects really just skimmed the surface of solid state physics, and I probably would have enjoyed pure physics studies more.
I resented the "applied" courses, which basically consisted of memorizing a bunch of heuristics about material classes and their properties.
I did mostly OK in the grades department but didn't excel and didn't really enjoy the subject matter; at that point it was just a game of passing the exams with minimal effort.

The interesting bits of materials science and the lack of any interesting bits in chemical engineering convinced me to do a masters in materials engineering.
I picked a bunch of courses on materials in nanotechnology which I found interesting, but I made my master thesis on a metallic alloys topic.
I loved the master thesis.
Trying to pick apart the puzzle of figuring out why certain compositions and processing conditions showed superior properties was exactly what I wanted to do at the time.
The project got me interested in the characterization methods and microscopy, but I always found it frustrating that I could maximally resolve about 10 nm (the department didn't have a transmission electron microscope (TEM)).
Then I had a course on TEM and instantly knew my calling.
